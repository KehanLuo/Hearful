This is the folder for task1: brand cleaning
There are two solutions for this task
1. Regular expression
    constructed 3 possible regular expressions
      a. brand name starts with "lauren"
      b. brand name starts with "polo"
      c. brand name starts with "ralph"
    Pro:
      Regular expression is more flexible and maybe faster than looping through a list and find matches.
    Con:
      It might also include some matches that are not correct. For example, there are two urls that are included in the result
      This solution cannot distinguish urls with proper brand name clearly.
2. Brand list
    Go through the original data and build a list of all possible combinations
    Pro:
      Starightforward, easy
    Con:
      It is not as flexible as regular expression
      Takes manual effort to keep the list updated
      Might miss some possible cominations that are not present in current dataset, but might appear in the future
