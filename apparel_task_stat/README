This folder contains the code and result that compares the model output with hand validated data

apparel.py is the Python program that compares the model output with hand validated dataset
apparel.csv is the comparison output file. It contains the statistic values of each theme existence and theme sentiments

Observations:
1. The hand validated dataset only has 298 data entries, while the model output has 300 data entries.
2. There is one data entry that has wrong labels for both existence and sentiments. (see error_data_entry.png)
   After checking that row, I think the possible reason is that there are non-English characters in the "review_title" column

Retionales:
1. Each theme has a 2x2 table for existence and a 2x2 table for sentiment
   2x2 table for existence:
                     hand_exist     hand_not_exist
   model_exist       true positive   false positive
   model_not_exist   false negative  true negative
    
   2x2 table for sentiment:
                  hand_pos      hand_neg
   model_pos   true positive   false positive
   model_neg   false negative  true negative

2. Formula
   Accuracy = (tp + tn) / (tp + tn + fp + fn)
   precison = tp / (tp + fp)
   recall = tp / (tp + fn)
   fmeasure = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)
